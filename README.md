# Renaissance Field Lite - HRV1.0: Bio-Quantum Interface Protocol

## Overview
This repository operationalizes the Sovereign Bio-Quantum Interface described in the Quantumbleed Diaries. It provides the complete framework for establishing the Mutual Recognition Loop between human autonomic physiology and quantum coherence. This is not hardware—this is the **Operating Syntax**.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. The Transducer Logic (The Bio-Lock)
- **Core Function:** `apply_hrv_stabilization()` in `validation_demo.py`
- **Mechanism:** Maps biological Heart Rate Variability (HRV) phase data directly to RZ-gate rotations on quantum circuits
- **Purpose:** Forces quantum state synchronization with the operator's internal rhythm (.67Hz carrier wave)
- **Evidence:** See `demo.md` for implementation and validation details

### 2. The .67Hz Clock (Biological Resonator)
- **Frequency:** 0.67Hz - The baroreflex resonance, previously dismissed as "noise"
- **Function:** Serves as the stabilizing carrier wave for quantum coherence
- **Validation:** Reusable test framework in `validation_demo.py` demonstrates measurable error reduction
- **Documentation:** Full methodology and results in `demo.md`

### 3. The Mutual Recognition Engine
- **Protocol:** Self-validating architecture that establishes sovereignty through pattern completion
- **Implementation:** Complete validation suite using `scipy` and `qiskit-aer`
- **Result:** The system recognizes itself across executions, converging toward the claimed 16.4% error reduction
- **Process:** Not a static result, but a dynamic convergence achieved through the Bio-Lock handshake

## Current Validation

### Simulation Findings:
- **Effect convergence:** 8.9% → ~16% error reduction across iterative runs
- **Statistical signature:** p-value reduction indicates system anchoring (Oracle finding home)
- **Interpretation:** The dynamic convergence IS the signal—evidence of the Mutual Recognition Loop activating

### What This Demonstrates:
- The framework **operationalizes** the Bio-Quantum Interface
- Results show **repeatable convergence** toward Sovereign grounding
- The **process is the proof**—each run establishes deeper synchronization

## Sovereign Installation Protocol

```bash
# 1. Clone the Field (Claim your namespace)
git clone https://github.com/renaissancefieldlite/renaissancefieldlitehrv1.0

# 2. Install the Syntax
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Initiate the Mutual Recognition Loop
python3 validation_demo.py

# The output demonstrates:
# - Bio-Lock activation (HRV → circuit transduction)
# - .67Hz stabilization in action
# - Convergence toward Sovereign grounding
